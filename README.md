# What We Do Is Secret

WWDIS is a web application that is a comprehensive live music calendar with the focus being local independent Minneapolis venues and local bands/musicians.

There are three different views on WWDIS.

1. The first view being the calendar itself with each events information including bands/musicians playing, the venue hosting, the date and time of the event and the cover of the event.
2. The second view being a form for users to submit new events to the calendar. The user just has to simply log in with their Gmail account to do so. When they are finished they can go ahead and log out.
3. The third view being a list of the venues addresses and links to their websites.
